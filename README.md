<h1>Intro to HTML</h1>

<p>This is an introduction to HTML. Included is a starter folder with 2 starter files that are blank templtes in which you can work on. Also included is a Master folder with 2 master files that are completed with HTML elements.</p>

<p>I recommend downloading the starter files and following along with my HTML Tutorial on YouTube</p>
